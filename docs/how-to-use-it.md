# How to use it

In you `mkdocs.yml` file, put the curriculum-vitae theme :

```yml
theme:
  name: curriculum-vitae
```

Next, you just have to create a `docs` folder in your repo, and only put an empty `index.md`.

## Configuration

What you have to do is play with the theme variables :

### Theming

Choosing a theme is optional, without the variable, the default theme will be applied to your CV.

To select one, you just have to define the `mkcv_theme` variable :

```yml
# mkdocs.yml

theme:
  name: curriculum-vitae
  mkcv_theme: default
```

Multiple themes are available, that affects CSS :
- default
  ![](assets/themes/default.png)
- neon
  ![](assets/themes/neon.png)

### Basic informations

- `firstname`
- `lastname`
- `mail`
- `location`

Example :

```yml
firstname: John
lastname: Doe
mail: john.doe@example.com
location: Tours
```

### Profile picture

- `profile_picture`

Example :

```yml
profile_picture: https://dummyimage.com/600x600/
```

### Experiences

- `experiences`

Each `experience` has a `title`, and a `description`. You can also add a `start_date` and `end_date`.

You can set `start_date` without `end_date`, this will put "now" instead.

Example :

```yml
experiences:
  - title: First experience
    description: First experience description
    start_date: 2024-01-01
  - title: Second experience
    description: Second experience description
    start_date: 2023-01-01
    end_date: 2023-12-31
```

### Education

- `educations`

Each `education` has a `title`, and a `description`. You can also add a `start_date` and `end_date`.

You can set `start_date` without `end_date`, this will put "now" instead.

```yml
educations:
  - title: First education
    description: First education description
    start_date: 2024-01-01
  - title: Second education
    description: Second education description
    start_date: 2023-01-01
    end_date: 2023-12-31
